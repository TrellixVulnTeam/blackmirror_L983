# Black Mirror
What if your social network turned against you? Black Mirror is a project that aims to reduce bullying by making people understand how it feels to be bullied.

## Description
Bullying is something that happens everywhere but ways to prevent or stop it fall often short. In many cases,  the bully doesn’t understand how bad it feels to be bullied. What if we could make the bully understand how bad it feels to be bullied?

In the modern world, we spend a lot of time online. Online communication on Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram feel as real as spending time with your friends outside the virtual world. Many consider this to be a bad thing; we instead think that the virtual world provides great opportunities. Real-world is fairly hard to simulate, but the virtual one is not. The latest achievements in deep learning have made it possible to create artificial faces and voice that can’t be separated from the actual sources. With these tools it’s possible to create situations where even the smartest of us can not be sure of is the content real or not.

Black Mirror is a project where your favorite social media platform turns against you. You will experience the modern cyberbullying techniques and understand how it feels to be bullied. Our mission is to make people understand how being bullied feels. We create conversations that take an unpleasant tone automatically. On top of this, we have our meme engine; it will make you become a laughing-stock. The last dimension in bullying is identity theft. We create a fake profile of you; seeing your name and face in a context that you would never approve yourself will make you feel anxious. These small but powerful methods will make the world a better place by reducing bullying step by step. Once the bully understands the outcomes of their actions no one will want to do it anymore.
